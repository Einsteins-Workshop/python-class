# We are going to print a tic-tac-toe board
# First, store the board state in a list
 

# Print the board three elements at a time.
print(board[0], "|", board[1], "|", board[2])
print("---------")

# Continue printing the rest of the board

# Ask the user for a square
square = input("choose a number to put a number.")
# Replace the appropriate part of the board list with an "X"

# Print the board again with the new X.
