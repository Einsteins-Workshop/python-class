# We are going to print a tic-tac-toe board
# First, store the board state in a list

# Extend the board to contain nine squares
board = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Print the board three elements at a time.
print(board[0], "|", board[1], "|", board[2])
print("---------")
print(board[3], "|", board[4], "|", board[5])
print("---------")
print(board[6], "|", board[7], "|", board[8])
# Continue printing the rest of the board

# Ask the user for a square

# Replace the appropriate part of the board list with an "X"

# Print the board again with the new X.
