# Look at sample_3_math.py and sample_6_for_and_while_loops for example statements

# Ask the user for a number
number = int(input("7r\n"))

# Use a for loop and the range function to loop from 1 to number
for i in range(0): # This needs to be completed.
    pass # Remove this
    # Print the square of the loop variable i.
