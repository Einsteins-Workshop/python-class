# Adapted from https://github.com/VRohit1901/ChatBot-Flask/
#
# This project gives the chassis for a chat bot experience.  It firsts asks for a name to
# and assumes that each name represents a distinct user.
#
# One suggestion is to create a chatbot that, when it sees a new message from the user, asks
# for a response, and otherwise repeats the user. Here are the possible steps:
#
# 1. For each user, create a file that represents the JSON string of a dictionary, where the
# key is the user message and the value is the desired response.  The dictionary will start
# empty, and the file name should be based on the user.
#
# 2. With each message, load the file into a dictionary and check to see if the message is a key
# in it.
#
#    2a. If so, respond with the message
#
#    2b. If not, ask the user for the desired response. Save the response to the dictionary and
#        save it to the file.
#
# As a further elaboration, if the message is not defined by the user but is defined by the majority
# of other users, use that response instead.
#
# As a further bonus, there can be a small percentage for messages with a response where the
# chatbot asks for confirmation that the response is correct.
#
# To run this webserver, you can run the following command line:
# python -m flask â€”app chat run.
